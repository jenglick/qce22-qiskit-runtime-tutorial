## About this Tutorial

As larger quantum systems become available, the need to be able to execute more complex quantum workloads has become more  pressing.  The  need  to  run  algorithms  that  combine  classical  and  quantum  computation  in  the  same  execution  cycle is  driving  new  requirements  for  both  what  is  needed  to  program  quantum  systems  and  the  context  in  which  results  are interpreted.  In  this  tutorial,  we  will  introduce  users  to  Qiskit  Runtime  primitives,  a  new  programming  model,  powered  by  a set of foundational functions, that enable a user to more seamlessly define and tailor quantum-classical workloads across the respective resources. We will show users how to build and optimize algorithms in this programming model in order to optimize their execution for speed and solution quality on today’s quantum systems using IBM’s Qiskit Runtime Service. Additionally, we will also show users how to experiment with trading off speed and accuracy using convenient inputs in this programming model that allows you to seamlessly leverage the latest error mitigation techniques on IBM systems.
